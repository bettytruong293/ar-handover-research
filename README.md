# AR Handover Research â€“ Master's Thesis Project

## Overview
This repository contains materials and resources for my Master's thesis research project focused on **Augmented Reality (AR) for ICU Nurse Handover Processes**. The project aims to explore how AR can enhance the visualization and communication of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data during critical handover moments in Intensive Care Units.

## Research Goals
- Understand challenges in current handover processes.
- Identify user requirements through interviews and observations.
- Design and prototype AR interfaces for situated data visualization.
- Evaluate usability and perceived usefulness in a clinical context.
